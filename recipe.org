* area-of-ring
;; from HTDP - pp 17
;; Contract: area-of-ring : number number -> number
;;
;; Purpose: to compute the area of a ring whose 
;;          radius is outer and whose hole has
;;          a radius of inner.
;;
;; Example: (area-of-ring 5 3) should produce 50.24
;;
;; Definition: [refines the header]
(define (area-of-ring outer inner)
  (- (area-of-disk outer)
     (area-of-disk inner)))

;; Tests
(area-of-ring 5 3)

;; Expected Value
50.24
* profit
** Contracts, headers, purpose statements
(...fill this in from notebook...)
** working code
(define (profit ticket-price)
  (- (revenue ticket-price)
     (cost ticket-price)))

(define (revenue ticket-price)
  (* (attendance ticket-price) ticket-price))

(define (cost ticket-price)
  (+ 180
    (* .04 (attendance ticket-price))))

(define (attendance ticket-price)
  (+ 120
    (* (/ 15 .10) (- 5.00 ticket-price))))

** GUIDELINE ON AUXILIARY FUNCTIONS
"Formulate auxiliary function definitions for every
dependency between quantities mentioned in the problem
statement or discovered with example cases"
