The Lucas Tower provides a beautiful example
of tree recursion and provides a good context
for understanding recursive processes.

Assume you have three pegs and a set of disks,
all of different diameters, with holes in them
(so they can slide onto the pegs).

Wishful Thinking
----------------
1- Decide what will make the problem simpler;
2- Pretend you already know how to solve the
   simpler version of the problem;
3- Figure out how to use the solution of the 
   simpler problem to construct a solution to
   the original problem.

Solving through Wishful Thinking
--------------------------------
Move all but the bottom disk to the extra peg (by
wishful thinking), thus leaving the biggest disk
behind.

Move the leftover(biggest) disk to the destination
peg.

Move the pile of disks we stored on the extra peg
to the destination peg
