(...summarize intro...)

8.1 Triggers from Interlocking Contexts
---------------------------------------

8.1.1 A Fundamental Question and Four Answers
---------------------------------------------
Where is the self?
Where is consciousness?
Who is doing all of this thinking?

"I have excluded the self and consciousness as
rigorously as I could manage. My goal is a foundation
for sociology that does not depend on them."

"Person" is a "style", a by-product rather than a generator
of social process.

"Personalization" as a dead-end, which tends to "cripple
theory by enmeshing it in endless detail."
