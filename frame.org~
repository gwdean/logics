This document describes the "concept management
system" that I have been thinking about for the
last couple of years. It now seems time to do
something concrete, especially after speaking
with Dan from Loffles today.

What is a "Concept Management System"?
--------------------------------------
We will find out. The simple answer is that it
is a system for managing concepts. Now who
would want to manage concepts. My hypothesis
is that a lot of people need to manage concepts.
At least one person (me) would like to figure
out how to have something like this.

What is a Concept? (...from wiki...)
------------------
abstract idea
unit of meaning
unit of knowledge


How can Concepts link together?
-------------------------------

What do I need to do to get this up and running?
