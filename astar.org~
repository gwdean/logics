This is an explanation of the A* algorithm.
Adapted from Haverbeke's Eloquent JavaScript,
online version.

The A* is used when there are a lot of paths
that someone can travel, and the cost of 
getting lost makes going backwards prohibitively
expensive.

There are two pieces of data to keep track of:

Open List    -> contains the partial routes that must
                still be explored

Reached List -> Nodes we have seen/ shortest partial route

Start by adding a route that contains only the starting
node to the open list, and recording it in the reached list.

(...to be continued...)
