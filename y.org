The Y combinator is a higher-order function.
It takes a single argument, which is a non-
recursive function. It returns a version of
the function that isn't recursive.

A combinator is a lambda expression with no
free variables.

A free variable (i.e. a name/identifier in
the language) is a variable which isn't a 
bound variable. 

A bound variable is a variable which is 
contained inside the body of a lambda 
expression that has that variable name as
one of its arguments.

(lambda (x) x) ; -> x is bound
(lambda (x) y) ; -> y is bound     
(lambda (x) (lambda (y) x))
(lambda (x) (lambda (y) (x y)))
(x (lambda (y) y))
((lambda (x) x) y)
